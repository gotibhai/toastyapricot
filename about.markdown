Hoi, I'm Pushkin! I like to indulge in occasional ramblings about technology, life, philosophy and growth. 
I shoot sometimes -- still figuring out a way to showcase my work in a way that pleases me. 

* Software Engineer (aka Plumber) by trade
* Runner/Sports enthusiast
* Aspiring Maker/Creater

Oh and this is my third attempt at starting a blog - the charm must ensue they say.
