Why did I start blogging? That's a great question (I'm partially answering it for myself)

* Creating a community around you 
    * Feeling very limited in the physical community
    * Leverage the internet to find like minded people 
    * The environment is what you can make of it - physical limitations are surmountable
    * The urge to put out ideas and discuss with people who can add to the conversations

* To teach my present and future self
    * Learning in Public is greatly benecial - Documentation, Presentation and 
    * Following extensive Note-Taking recently however it has some holes
        * There's benefit in [working with the garage doors up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu)
        * Added accountability to from publically displaying your work

* I do love talking and expressing - even though writing isn't my favorite medium; it suits me for the following reasons:
    * It makes me more patient since I have to formulate and write
    * It makes me more specific and less abstract - comparing with street photography / arts
    * It allows you to clear your brain and flush your thoughts
    * It's one of the lowest friction ways to communicate with the masses

* To start creating ASAP - High Urgency
