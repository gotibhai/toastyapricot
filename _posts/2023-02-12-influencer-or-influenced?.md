On the verge of my first big social media detox, The term social media influencer popped in my head with the accompanying visual stereotypes of really hot people. It started to make me think - Who is an Influencer? Someone who is influencing others has to be grounded in some foundational principles. If you’re transient, flaky and unclear about yourself how can you influence. Influence again should be a second order side effect, just like success you can’t become an influencer. You can act according to your principles and let others be influenced by you. A coworker once told me “You can find me in the office Tuesday to Friday, weather independent” That’s a big deal given we’re residing in rainy Amsterdam 😅 That last part really moved me and influenced me positively. 

Reflecting on my journey, I found that I’m actually very easily influenced, There was definitely some room to grow with respect to grounding principles and values to uphold.
