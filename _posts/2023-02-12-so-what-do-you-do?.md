Great anecdote from this book “How?” It reminded me that I’ve been thinking about it so long. Two guys doing masonry work on a building. The first one, when asked what he was doing, says, “Laying Bricks.” The second replies, “Building a cathedral” Some people see themselves as bricklayers and others understand the real mission. When people asked me, I always used to say “I write code for a software startup” which in my head is equivalent to laying bricks. Try switching it to “I’m building a product which allows all companies to understand important insights from their data and make better business decisions” The change in attitude and the increased ownership is distinctly visible.
